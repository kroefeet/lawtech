    		<div class="col-md-8">
    		<p>I think there is an idea that librarians are supposed to be trustworthy human beings that exist to support people (all people). 
    		I feel like technology has made an effort to try to replace librarians in the area of information and research while also undermining the general population.
    		I hope to bring a bit of awareness to the costs of technology in every day life and help others get a grip on what they are doing with technology and why they are doing it.

    		<p>You should care about this because technology is all around us. We all need to choose the technology we use and think about why we are using it.</p>
